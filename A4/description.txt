This program collects tweets which have the words'Hillary' or 'Trump' in them. The code for this is written in collect.py.
Along with this, the Afinn data is also downloaded for sentiment analysis.
In the cluster.py file, a graph is created between all of the users. The graph is then clustered using Girvan Newman until the edge with the highest weight is removed.
In classify.py, the downloaded Afinn scores are used to weigh the sentiment of a tweet. On the whole, we find out whether users who used the word 'Trump' have more positive tweets than the users who used the word 'Hillary'. The results may surprise you.
Finally, in the summarize.py file, all the outputs of the previous functions are taken and the values are written to a summary.txt file.
Conclusion : The results from classify are surprising. The time taken to download 1000 tweets is roughly around 3 minutes.
